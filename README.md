# HousePricePrediction
Predicting the house price by doing EDA, feature engineering, feature scaling, feature selection and then applied the linear regression classifier
I have taken the dataset named train.csv for doing the preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, feature scaling.
After doing the feature selection I have saved the dataset to X_Train.csv and then on that I have applied the linear regression classifier.
To check the error in this I have calcualtaed the mean absolute error(MAE), mean squared error(MSE),root mean squared error(RMSE).
